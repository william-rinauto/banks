# banks

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of banks is to create a simple interface for someone to access
all of the quarterly call report date provided by the FDIC. The
functions provided in this package will make it very simple for you to
build and query a local database that contains thousands of data fields
on all FDIC insured banks, spread across hundreds of quarters going back
to 1992.

## Installation

You can install the released version of banks from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

``` r
install.packages("banks")
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
