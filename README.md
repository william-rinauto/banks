The goal of banks is to create a simple interface for someone to access
all of the quarterly call report date provided by the FDIC. The
functions provided in this package will make it very simple for you to
build and query a local database that contains thousands of data fields
on all FDIC insured banks, spread across hundreds of quarters going back
to 1992.

## Installation

You can install this development version of banks with:

``` r
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/william-rinauto/banks')
```
